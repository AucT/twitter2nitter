# twitter2nitter - redirect twitter to nitter
Share twitter url to this app, and you will be redirected.

This is useful for users of [materialistic](https://github.com/hidroh/materialistic) hackernews app.

p.s. After creating it for myself, I found untrackme app on f-droid, but my twitter2nitter app supports sharing text that includes twitter url. Which is why it is better than untrackme. Plus, source code is only 100 lines of kotlin.
