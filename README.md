# twitter2nitter - redirect twitter url to nitter
Share twitter url to my app, and you will be redirected

This is useful for users of hackernews using app [materialistic](https://github.com/hidroh/materialistic)

p.s. After I created it for myself, I have found untrackme app on f-droid, but my twitter2nitter app supports sharing text that includes twitter url. Which is why it is better than untrackme. Plus, source code is only 100 lines of kotlin.
